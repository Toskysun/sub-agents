## DELIVERABLE SPECIFICATIONS

**Docker Configuration:**
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build example
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine AS runtime
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nodeuser -u 1001
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder --chown=nodeuser:nodejs /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --chown=nodeuser:nodejs . .
USER nodeuser
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**Kubernetes Deployment:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-app
        image: app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          requests:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
```

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t app:${{ github.sha }} .
      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        run: kubectl set image deployment/app-deployment app=app:${{ github.sha }}
```
