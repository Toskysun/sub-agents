## Usage
`/ai <TASK_DESCRIPTION | list | info <role> | workflow | auto>`

## 🎯 Task Complexity Assessment

### Level 0: Micro Tasks - Direct execution
- **Scenario**: Information queries, file reading, status checks
- **Characteristics**: No code modification, pure information retrieval  
- **Boundary**: <5 minutes, no professional knowledge needed
- **Triggers**: "view", "check", "display", "read"
- **Action**: Main controller completes directly, no agent calls

### Level 1: Simple Tasks - Single agent direct
- **Scenario**: Single file modification, basic configuration, simple functionality
- **Characteristics**: <50 lines of code, single technology stack, clear requirements
- **Boundary**: One professional domain, no cross-module impact
- **Triggers**: "add", "modify", "configure" single components
- **Action**: Direct call to 1 professional agent, bypassing director

### Level 2: Medium Tasks - Single agent complex
- **Scenario**: Complete functional modules, multi-file coordination, requires testing
- **Characteristics**: 50-200 lines of code, requires planning and validation
- **Boundary**: Single technology stack but complex logic, may require refactoring
- **Triggers**: "implement", "develop", "build" complete features
- **Action**: 1 professional agent handles full process, main controller monitors

### Level 3: Composite Tasks - Multi-agent serial
- **Scenario**: Cross-module functionality, frontend-backend coordination, 2-3 professional domains
- **Characteristics**: 200-500 lines of code, requires multi-step coordination
- **Boundary**: Clear dependency relationships, serial execution
- **Triggers**: "integrate", "connect", "full-stack" functionality
- **Action**: Main controller serially calls 2-3 agents

### Level 4: Parallel Tasks - Multi-agent concurrent
- **Scenario**: Independent module parallel development, performance optimization, multi-platform
- **Characteristics**: 3-5 independent workflows, can execute in parallel
- **Boundary**: Low conflict risk, high independence
- **Triggers**: "simultaneously", "parallel", "multi-platform" development
- **Action**: Main controller calls 3-5 agents in parallel

### Level 5: Enterprise Tasks - Director coordination
- **Scenario**: System refactoring, architecture upgrades, complex project analysis
- **Characteristics**: 5+ professional domains, complex dependencies, multi-phase planning
- **Boundary**: Requires specialized task decomposition and coordination management
- **Triggers**: "refactor", "architecture", "system analysis", "enterprise-level"
- **Action**: task-dispatch-director pure coordination, decompose into Level 1-3 tasks

## ⚡ Auto-Trigger Matrix

**Level 0 Trigger Conditions (no agent calls):**
- Keywords: "view", "check", "display", "read", "list", "status"
- Questions: "what is", "how to understand", "can you explain"
- Operations: Pure information queries, no modification requirements

**Level 1 Trigger Conditions (single agent direct):**
- Keywords: "add", "modify", "update", "configure", "adjust"
- Scope: Single file or component + single technology stack
- Examples: "add Vue component", "modify API endpoint", "configure database connection"

**Level 2 Trigger Conditions (single agent complex):**
- Keywords: "implement", "develop", "build", "create" functional modules
- Scope: Multi-file but single technology stack + requires testing
- Examples: "implement user login", "develop payment module", "build search functionality"

**Level 3 Trigger Conditions (multi-agent serial):**
- Keywords: "integrate", "connect", "full-stack", "end-to-end"
- Scope: 2-3 technology stacks collaboration + clear dependencies
- Examples: "frontend-backend integration", "API integration", "full-stack user system"

**Level 4 Trigger Conditions (multi-agent parallel):**
- Keywords: "simultaneously", "parallel", "multi-platform", "optimize"
- Scope: 3-5 independent modules + low conflict
- Examples: "multi-platform synchronized development", "comprehensive performance optimization"

**Level 5 Trigger Conditions (Director coordination):**
- Keywords: "refactor", "architecture", "system analysis", "enterprise-level", "complete solution"
- Scope: 5+ professional domains + complex planning

**Mandatory Director Bypass Conditions (Level 0-2):**
- Single file operations
- Clearly specified single technology stack
- User explicitly says "no team collaboration needed"
- Simple information queries and basic modifications

## 🚫 Direct Handling
Handle without agents:
- File reading, searching, basic analysis
- Simple code modifications or config updates
- Information queries and technical explanations

## 🛡️ Anti-Over-Engineering Principles
- **One goal, one agent**: Only call one agent unless true collaboration needed
- **Minimum viable solution**: Choose simplest working method
- **User-oriented**: Based on explicit user needs, not assumptions

## 🎯 Project-Specific Agents Support

### Agent Discovery System
The AI system intelligently detects and integrates both:
- **Global Agents**: Standard agents from `/agents/` directory (always available)
- **Project Agents**: Custom agents from `.claude/agents/` directory (created by `/initx`)

### Project Agent Features
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically discovers agents in `.claude/agents/` when present
- **Priority System**: Project-specific agents take precedence over global agents
- **Smart Routing**: Intelligently routes to project agents when they match the task better
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with the same `/ai` command interface

### Using Project Agents
```bash
# After running /initx to create project-specific agents:
/ai "optimize checkout flow"  # Uses vue-ecommerce-developer if created
/ai "implement payment integration"  # Uses payment-integration-specialist
/ai list  # Shows both global and project agents
```

## 👥 Team Members (when using `/ai list`)

**Note**: This list shows global agents. If you have run `/initx`, project-specific agents from `.claude/agents/` will also be available and displayed with a 🏢 icon.
