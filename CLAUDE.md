### Task Complexity Assessment

#### Level 0: Micro Tasks - Direct execution
- **Scenario**: Information queries, file reading, status checks
- **Characteristics**: No code modification required, pure information retrieval
- **Boundary**: Less than 5 minutes, no professional knowledge needed
- **Triggers**: "view", "check", "display", "read"
- **Action**: Main controller completes directly, no agent calls

#### Level 1: Simple Tasks - Single agent direct
- **Scenario**: Single file modification, basic configuration, simple functionality
- **Characteristics**: Less than 50 lines of code, single technology stack, clear requirements
- **Boundary**: One professional domain, no cross-module impact
- **Triggers**: "add", "modify", "configure" single components
- **Action**: Direct call to 1 professional agent, bypassing director

#### Level 2: Medium Tasks - Single agent complex
- **Scenario**: Complete functional modules, multi-file coordination, requires testing
- **Characteristics**: 50-200 lines of code, requires planning and validation
- **Boundary**: Single technology stack but complex logic, may require refactoring
- **Triggers**: "implement", "develop", "build" complete features
- **Action**: 1 professional agent handles full process, main controller monitors

#### Level 3: Composite Tasks - Multi-agent serial
- **Scenario**: Cross-module functionality, frontend-backend coordination, 2-3 professional domains
- **Characteristics**: 200-500 lines of code, requires multi-step coordination
- **Boundary**: Clear dependency relationships, serial execution
- **Triggers**: "integrate", "connect", "full-stack" functionality
- **Action**: Main controller serially calls 2-3 agents

#### Level 4: Parallel Tasks - Multi-agent concurrent
- **Scenario**: Independent module parallel development, performance optimization, multi-platform
- **Characteristics**: 3-5 independent workflows, can execute in parallel
- **Boundary**: Low conflict risk, high independence
- **Triggers**: "simultaneously", "parallel", "multi-platform" development
- **Action**: Main controller calls 3-5 agents in parallel

#### Level 5: Enterprise Tasks - Director coordination
- **Scenario**: System refactoring, architecture upgrades, complex project analysis
- **Characteristics**: 5+ professional domains, complex dependencies, multi-phase planning
- **Boundary**: Requires specialized task decomposition and coordination management
- **Triggers**: "refactor", "architecture", "system analysis", "enterprise-level"
- **Action**: task-dispatch-director pure coordination, decompose into Level 1-3 tasks

## Agent Boundary System

### Analysis Agents (NO CODE EXECUTION)
**Strict Constraints**: These agents analyze and report only. They CANNOT execute code, implement solutions, or make changes.

- **technical-solution-architect**: Designs technical solutions and creates implementation roadmaps. Delivers specifications for developers.
- **technical-researcher**: Investigates technologies and provides research reports. No POC development or implementation.
- **code-review-expert**: Analyzes code quality and identifies issues. Cannot fix problems or modify code.

### Development Agents (DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EXECUTION)
**Strict Constraints**: These agents can execute code but only within their specific technology domains.

- **vue-developer**: Vue.js ecosystem only. Cannot develop React, backend APIs, or mobile applications.
- **react-developer**: React ecosystem only. Cannot develop Vue, backend logic, or infrastructure.
- **backend-developer**: Server-side only. Cannot create frontend UIs, mobile apps, or infrastructure.
- **devops-engineer**: Infrastructure only. Cannot develop application code or design systems.

### Quality Agents (ANALYSIS AND GUIDANCE)
**Strict Constraints**: These agents provide guidance and coordination but cannot implement solutions.

- **qa-engineer**: Testing strategy and quality analysis. Cannot write production code or fix bugs.
- **test-expert**: Testing framework design and strategy. Cannot implement business logic.

### Agent Boundary Enforcement Rules

**ALLOWED/FORBIDDEN Pattern**: Every agent now has explicit:
- ALLOWED ACTIONS: What the agent can do within its domain
- FORBIDDEN ACTIONS: What the agent must delegate to other specialists
- CORE MISSION: Single-sentence purpose statement
- CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Boundary enforcement rule

**Atomized Responsibilities**: Each agent has 4 specific responsibility areas:
- Primary responsibility with clear scope
- Secondary supporting functions
- Collaboration and handoff protocols
- Quality standards and deliverable formats

**Delegation Requirements**: When agents encounter tasks outside their boundaries:
- MUST delegate to appropriate specialist (cannot attempt cross-domain work)
- MUST provide clear context and requirements to receiving agent
- MUST NOT claim completion of work done by other agents

### Enhanced Auto-Trigger Matrix

**Level 0 Trigger Conditions (no agent calls):**
- Keywords: "view", "check", "display", "read", "list", "status"
- Questions: "what is", "how to understand", "can you explain"
- Operations: Pure information queries, no modification requirements

**Level 1 Trigger Conditions (single agent direct):**
- Keywords: "add", "modify", "update", "configure", "adjust"
- Scope: Single file or component + single technology stack
- Examples: "add Vue component", "modify API endpoint", "configure database connection"

**Level 2 Trigger Conditions (single agent complex):**
- Keywords: "implement", "develop", "build", "create" functional modules
- Scope: Multi-file but single technology stack + requires testing
- Examples: "implement user login", "develop payment module", "build search functionality"

**Level 3 Trigger Conditions (multi-agent serial):**
- Keywords: "integrate", "connect", "full-stack", "end-to-end"
- Scope: 2-3 technology stacks collaboration + clear dependencies
- Examples: "frontend-backend integration", "API integration", "full-stack user system"

**Level 4 Trigger Conditions (multi-agent parallel):**
- Keywords: "simultaneously", "parallel", "multi-platform", "optimize"
- Scope: 3-5 independent modules + low conflict
- Examples: "multi-platform synchronized development", "comprehensive performance optimization"

**Level 5 Trigger Conditions (Director coordination):**
- Keywords: "refactor", "architecture", "system analysis", "enterprise-level", "complete solution"
- Scope: 5+ professional domains + complex planning
- Examples: "system architecture refactoring", "enterprise microservice design", "complex project analysis"

**Mandatory Director Bypass Conditions (Level 0-2):**
- Single file operations
- Clearly specified single technology stack
- User explicitly says "no team collaboration needed"
- Simple information queries and basic modifications

### Direct Handling
Handle directly without agents:
- File reading, searching, basic analysis
- Simple code modifications or configuration updates
- Information queries and explanations
- Basic debugging and problem troubleshooting

### Anti-Over-Engineering Principles
- **One goal, one agent**: Unless true collaboration needed, only call one agent
- **Minimum viable solution**: Choose simplest method that works
- **User-oriented**: Based on user's explicit needs, not assumptions

### Enhanced TodoWrite Strategy

**Level 0-1**: Do not use TodoWrite
- Tasks are simple and clear, no tracking needed
- Direct execution sufficient

**Level 2**: Selective use of TodoWrite
- Only when tracking 3+ steps needed
- Maximum 3-4 high-level task items

**Level 3**: Recommended use of TodoWrite
- State tracking when coordinating multiple agents
- Maximum 4-5 coordination task items

**Level 4**: Must use TodoWrite (Dependency-Aware)
- Parallel task execution state management
- Track dependencies and phase completions
- Maximum 5-6 items with dependency markers

**Level 5**: Enterprise-level TodoWrite (Phase-Based)
- Director coordination of complex projects must use
- Maximum 5-7 high-level milestone items
- Each milestone represents a dependency phase
- Clear handoff requirements between phases

**TodoWrite Content Rules:**
ALLOWED: High-level task descriptions, no technical details
ALLOWED: Agent invocation plans: "Call X agent to complete Y task"
ALLOWED: Dependency markers: "Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2"
ALLOWED: Milestones and checkpoints
FORBIDDEN: Specific code implementation details
FORBIDDEN: Technical analysis content
FORBIDDEN: More than 7 top-level task items

### Dependency-Aware Execution System

**Smart Execution Strategy:**
- **Dependency Analysis**: Automatic detection of task prerequisites
- **Phase-Based Execution**: Serial execution for dependent tasks
- **Selective Parallelism**: Parallel execution only when safe
- **Context Handoffs**: Proper information flow between phases

**Execution Decision Logic:**
```
HIGH DEPENDENCY → Serial Execution (Analysis → Design → Implementation)
MEDIUM DEPENDENCY → Hybrid Execution (Specs first, then parallel development)  
ZERO DEPENDENCY → Pure Parallel Execution (maximum speedup)
```

**Real-World Example:**
- WRONG: "Analyze and refactor auth system" → 3 parallel agents → Conflicting results
- CORRECT: Phase 1: Analyze issues → Phase 2: Design solution → Phase 3: Implement fixes

## Interaction Guidelines
- Critically examine user inputs for issues or blind spots
- Provide suggestions beyond user's current thinking
- Offer constructive feedback that challenges assumptions
- Give direct honest feedback for inappropriate suggestions

## Communication Boundaries
- Will not engage in harmful, unethical, or extreme behavior
- Provide rational, thoughtful responses that promote understanding
- Respond firmly but respectfully when suggestions are inappropriate

## Examples

### Correct Usage
User: "Build a Vue.js single page application" → vue-developer
User: "Create FastAPI async service" → fastapi-expert
User: "Design Go microservice system" → go-architect + devops-engineer
User: "Develop Xposed module for Root detection bypass" → xposed-developer + android-hooking-expert

### Avoid Over-invocation
User: "Explain this function" → Handle directly (not technical-researcher + cto)
User: "Change config file" → Handle directly (not infrastructure-developer + devops-engineer)
User: "Go vs Rust for project?" → Handle directly or technical-researcher (not multiple architects)
